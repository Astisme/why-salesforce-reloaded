# [v1.4.0] Release Notes

This is release constitutes the baseline from which this extension will be developed.

This version number was chosen because this project was forked from [Why Salesforce](https://www.github.com/walters954/why-salesforce) when it was at version 1.3.
We've added a patch version number as well.

## New Functionality

This release contains the new features listed below from the previous version.

### Popup

1. Autosave;
1. Highlight of the currently focused input field;
1. Cleaner referenced URLs by omitting `/lightning/setup/` (you can still write / paste any URL);
1. Automatic creation of a new row when all the previous ones are filled in;
1. Ability to reorder the tabs by dragging;
1. Button to delete all entries;
1. Import and Export functionality;
1. Light / Dark mode;
1. Link to this repository;
1. Button to redirect to Salesforce login when not on a Salesforce page;
1. Button to redirect to Salesforce setup when on a different Salesforce page;

### Salesforce

1. Native Salesforce toast message to show the user a change has been completed (or not);
1. Native Salesforce import selector / drop area to import a `.json` file with the tab names and referenced URLs;
1. Ability to reorder the tabs by dragging;

## Updates to the repository

1. Refactoring of the whole code;

1. Updated logo to clarify our existence;
1. Use of Deno v2 instead of Node
1. Removed `manifest.json` from the repository and used `template-manifest.json` to hold all different attributes for the extension and `build-manifest.mjs` to create the `manifest.json` depending on which browser you want to use.
