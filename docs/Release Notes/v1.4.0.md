# [v1.4.0] Release Notes

This release constitutes the baseline from which this extension will be developed.

This version number was chosen because this project was forked from [Why Salesforce](https://www.github.com/walters954/why-salesforce) when it was at version 1.3. We've added a patch version number as well.

## New Functionality

This release contains the new features listed below from the previous version.

### Popup

1. Autosave;
2. Highlight of the currently focused input field;
3. Cleaner referenced URLs by omitting `/lightning/setup/` (you can still write / paste any URL);
4. Automatic creation of a new row when all the previous ones are filled in;
5. Ability to reorder the tabs by dragging;
6. Button to delete all entries;
7. Import and Export functionality;
8. Light / Dark mode;
9. Link to this repository;
10. Button to redirect to Salesforce login when not on a Salesforce page;
11. Button to redirect to Salesforce setup when on a different Salesforce page.

### Salesforce

1. Native Salesforce toast message to show the user a change has been completed (or not);
2. Native Salesforce import selector / drop area to import a `.json` file with the tab names and referenced URLs;
3. Ability to reorder the tabs by dragging;
4. Highlight of the saved tab when on its referenced page;
5. Dynamic creation of a favourite / unfavourite current page button;
6. Reload of tabs when a new one is added / when one (or more) is deleted.

## Updates to the repository

1. Refactoring of the whole code;
2. Creation of dedicated directories;
3. Creation of our own license (when the project was forked, there was none available. Now we feature both the one we picked and also the one from the original project);
4. Updated logo to clarify our existence;
5. Use of Deno v2 instead of Node;
6. Removed `manifest.json` from the repository and used `template-manifest.json` to hold all different attributes for the extension and `build-manifest.mjs` to create the `manifest.json` depending on which browser you want to use.
